# Solutions to algorithms

In this directory there are all the algorithms introduced in the course implemented in Python. The files of this kinds are named according to the following naming convention:

```[lecture number]-[lecture-title]_listing_[listing_number]_[algorithm_name].py```

for instance:

 ```02-algorithms_listing_8_contains_word.py```
 
 In addition, all the exercises that requested the creation of a new algorithm for solving some specific computational problem have been added as well. The files of this kinds are named according to the following naming convention:

```[lecture number]-[lecture-title]_ex_[exercise_number]_[algorithm_name].py```

for instance:

 ```05-brute-force-algorithms_ex_1_enumerate.py```
